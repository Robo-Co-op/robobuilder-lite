"""Every shipped agent must be dispatched by at least one skill.

Ported from robobuilder-standard, where five of nine agents shipped unwired.
In robobuilder-lite the gap was, and
three of those named the skill they belong to in their own description:

  - requirements-validator: "Use after /to-prd is generated" -- to-prd never
    dispatched it
  - tdd-pair: "Use whenever /tdd is invoked" -- tdd never dispatched it
  - codebase-explorer: "for the Phase 0.5 workflow" -- zoom-out, the Phase 0.5
    skill, never dispatched it
  - design-critic: "Complements the interactive /grill-me" -- grill-me never
    dispatched it
  - release-notes-writer: "Use during /ship" -- ship never dispatched it

They were installed and invisible: reachable only if a user named them by hand.
Same shape as the rest of this repo's defects -- a step declared to run that
never ran.

A note on how this test counts, because a naive version got it wrong. The first
pass at this survey searched raw skill text and concluded only three agents were
unwired, because `upgrade` renders a mock console diff containing the lines
"AGENTS ~ design-critic (modified)" and "+ agents/release-notes-writer.md
(added)". Those are sample output, not dispatches. So fenced code blocks and
blockquotes -- the two places this repo puts example output and sample dialogue
-- are stripped before matching. Without that, an agent named only in an example
counts as wired and the test blesses exactly the bug it exists to catch.
