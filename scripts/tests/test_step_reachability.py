"""Every numbered step in a skill must be reachable.

Ported from robobuilder-standard, where three such jumps had shipped.
A skill written as "Step 1 ... Step 20" is a program, and its forward jumps are
gotos. Nothing checked where they landed, so three of them landed past work
that was not optional:

  - `ship` Step 6 sent both of its exits to Step 9, skipping the test coverage
    audit, the plan completion audit, plan verification and scope drift
    detection. The exit that fires is "no prompt-related files changed" —
    the path every repo without that one Rails eval suite takes, i.e. nearly
    all of them.
  - `ship` Steps 9.3 and 10 sent three exits to Step 12, skipping Step 11,
    which is titled "Adversarial review (always-on)" and opens "Every diff gets
    adversarial review." The exits that fire are "no issues found" and "no
    review comments" — so the review was skipped exactly when nothing else had
    looked.
  - `land-and-deploy` sent both CI outcomes to Step 4 (Merge the PR), skipping
    Step 3.4 and Step 3.5. Step 3.5 is titled "Pre-merge readiness gate" and
    says "This is the critical safety check before an irreversible merge." It
    was unreachable on every path.

Same shape as the scoring bugs in this repo: a check that never runs reads
exactly like a check that passed. This test makes a skipped section fail the
suite unless someone has written down why the skip is correct.
