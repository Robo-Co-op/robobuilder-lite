"""A review that never renders the page cannot report on how the page renders.

`improve` is the whole review surface here, and it is also the review step Pro's
`dev-loop` calls in Phase 2 of every slice it ships. Its default mode dispatched three
agents, none of which can open a browser, and `--deep` reached for `e2e-tester` only
"(for UI changes)" -- a judgement the maker makes about its own change, and the same
defect `build` carried until `tdd-pair`'s trigger became an observable fact. Gating an
independent check on the self-assessment it exists to replace means the check goes
unused in exactly the cases that needed it, and here that reaches every autonomous
loop downstream.

So the trigger has to be a fact about the diff, not an opinion about it, and the
skill has to say what it reports when the browser check cannot run at all. A skipped
render check that prints nothing is an unmeasured thing counted as a pass, which is
the failure this whole suite exists to refuse.
